  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytics framework that can serve as a decision support tool for HR recruiters in real-world settings in order to improve hiring and placement decisions. The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.}

  abstract = { Effective candidates screening is critical for any IT firm as it impacts the future growth and productivity of that firm. Currently majority of these firms follow a manual approach of hiring employees which is more prone to errors and time consuming. Prime purpose of the research is to develop an intelligent predictive model to decide upon candidate’s suitability for an applied It based job. A sample size of 13,168 instances with 19 attributes of job seekers data are used for study. An ensemble predictive meta model approach is presented in the research where a stacked KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) algorithm combined with hard voting approach is employed. The idea is to use a single unified predictive model in place of separate classification models by considering the predicted class with maximum votes against each class label. The proposed approach comprises two functional modules. ‘Stacked KNN Learner Module’ involves the use of five variants of KNN which include 1-NN, 3-NN, 5-NN, 7-NN and 9-NN. Individual prediction of the job seeker data from these variants of KNN algorithm are input to the ‘Hard Voting Ensemble Predictive unit’ which eventually aggregates majority of predicted class votes determined for each class label to generate the final output predicted class label on basis of maximum votes. The developed ensemble meta model is successfully implemented using python programming language and its performance evaluation is done using various metrics. The implemented model generated a 96.96\% prediction accuracy rate. The specificity, sensitivity and f-score value recorded was 96.36\%, 96.06\% and 96.26\% respectively. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root mean Square Error (RMSE) value observed with our proposed meta model was 0.0048 and 0.0102 respectively. A comparative analysis of the proposed model was done by varying the data sample size and it gave a consistent performance throughout. It was observed that proposed ensemble model gave an impressive 96.96\% mean accuracy rate and the overall performance of other variants was consistent. Performance of proposed meta model was also compared with some existing techniques like C.45, CART and K-Means. It outperformed other techniques in terms of accurately predicting the class label of candidates applying for job. This ensemble meta model can be of great help for growing IT firms and assist the organization unit in hiring right and deserving candidates in future. Proposed work can act as a decision making framework in multi sector units with enormous work force to streamline performance appraisal process thereby enabling in hiring right people for right job.}

  abstract = {In the nowadays-competitive race of finding a suitable talented, qualified, bright and potential personnel to fulfill the needed spot of a vacancy in an industry, and with the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution, employers are taking the hiring process to the digital world. As Artificial Intelligent (AI) has a high-speed computation and adaptively to big data, it used to analyses and represents the data to employers in an easy way so they can make their decisions effectively.An upcoming challenge is raised where if the new candidates for a vacancy will give the expected performance based on the hiring criteria's or not, and how to hire a candidate that will while dealing with the hiring process? Employers are concerned with the performance evaluation of their current employees, but it is a challenge knowing the performance of new candidates before hiring.This study is proposing a follow-up conceptual model of using Artificial Intelligent (AI) in the hiring process with the using of performance management and social screening to predict the new candidate expected performance by analyzing historical performances and conditions of employees. This method will give an additional parameter that assists the decision makers in the hiring process.Although this method is a step forward to eliminate bad hiring, but it is requiring a huge historical data including the tracking of the performance, personal information collected from several sources like surveys and social Media and employees conditions related to the time of old and current employees, to give results that are more efficient and accurate.}

  abstractNote={Several higher institution of learning faces issue or difficulty of turning out more than 90\% of their graduates who can competently satisfy and meet the requirements of the industry. However, the industry is also confronted with the difficulty of sourcing skilled tertiary institution graduates that match their needs. Failure or success of any organization depends mostly on how its workforce is recruited and retained. Therefore, the selection of an acceptable or satisfactory candidate for the job position is one of the major and vital problems of management decision-making. This work, therefore, proposes a modern, accurate and worthy machine learning classification model that can be deployed, implemented, and put to use when making predictions and assessments on job applicant's attributes from their academic performance datasets in other to meet the selection criteria for the industry. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning classifiers were considered in this work. Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, support vector machine (SVM). Random Forest and Decision tree performed well, but Logistic Regression outperformed others with 93\% accuracy.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

  abstract={Data mining is the discovery of interesting, unexpected or valuable structures in large datasets. As such, it has two rather different aspects. One of these concerns large-scale, `global' structures, and the aim is to model the shapes, or features of the shapes, of distributions. The other concerns small-scale, `local' structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary. This paper gives a lightning overview of data mining and its relation to statistics, with particular emphasis on tools for the detection of adverse drug reactions.},

Our fairness constraint requires that an algorithm never prefers one action over another if the long-term (discounted) reward of choosing the latter action is higher. Our first result is negative: despite the fact that fairness is consistent with the optimal policy, any learning algorithm satisfying fairness must take time exponential in the number of states to achieve non-trivial approximation to the optimal policy. We then provide a provably fair polynomial time algorithm under an approximate notion of fairness, thus establishing an exponential gap between exact and approximate fairness.}

  abstract = {Any business's success depends on its employees. Businesses that realize this are concerned about employee output and productivity. Productivity has a compounding effect at the different levels in the workplace, meaning that high productivity at a lower level of organization paves way for higher productivity at the higher levels of the organization. Hence, analysis of performance of employees in any organization is the need of the hour. Performance of an employee cannot be attributed to any fixed quality. Different people have different skill sets and different behavioral characteristics. Thus, performance analysis requires data to be gathered from all walks of life.The purpose of this paper is to analyze and predict the performance of employees in an organization on the basis of various factors, including, but not limited to, individual and domain specific characteristics, nature and level of schooling, socioeconomic status and different psychological factors.This research paper uses Supervised learning techniques namely Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks and Logistic Regression which considers these factors and provides insights into the performance and commitment of employees. The employees are classified into 3 output classes indicating the level of their performance from low to high.In this research paper, 10-fold validation technique is used to ensure the correctness of the prediction by the above-mentioned techniques. Support Vector Machines prove to be the most efficient in terms of accuracy. The result is accentuated by the high validation score obtained by the same.Also, Employee's Creativity stands out as the most impactful feature.},

  abstract = {Absenteeism at workplace acts as a crucial role in demonstrating the productive and profitable capacity of a company. Thus the knowledge of absenteeism of employees' becomes the foundation for an organization in its multiple dimensions. Because the proper determination of employees' profile allows the identification of excesses of occurrences of certain morbidities. The early absenteeism research primarily focused on predicting the characteristics and the categories of diseases of employees that make them perform higher absenteeism at workplace. However, predicting the absenteeism time of employees using different machine learning classifiers is able to give the researches a new dimension in line with the intention of revealing the underlying causes and patterns of absenteeism. In this paper, we have applied 4 prominent machine learning algorithms namely Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest, and Tree Ensemble on the absenteeism dataset of a courier company in Brazil in order to predict the absenteeism time of employees at work as well as the best classifier. Based on the 7 evaluation metrics such as True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy we found that Gradient Boosted Tree produced the best result with an accuracy rate of 82\% whereas Tree Ensemble performed the lowest with the accuracy rate of 79\%.},

  Peter Cappelli confronts the myth of the skills gap and
  provides an actionable path forward to put people back to
  work. Even in a time of perilously high unemployment,
  companies contend that they cannot find the employees they need.
  Pointing to a skills gap, employers argue applicants are simply not
  qualified; schools aren't preparing students for jobs; the
  government isn't letting in enough high-skill immigrants; and even
  when the match is right, prospective employees won't accept jobs at
  the wages offered. In this powerful and fast-reading book, Peter
  Cappelli, Wharton management professor and director of Wharton's
  Center for Human Resources, debunks the arguments and exposes the
  real reasons good people can't get hired. Drawing on jobs data,
  anecdotes from all sides of the employer-employee divide, and
  interviews with jobs professionals, he explores the paradoxical
  forces bearing down on the American workplace and lays out
  solutions that can help us break through what has become a
  crippling employer-employee stand-off. Among the questions he
  confronts: Is there really a skills gap? To what extent is the
  hiring process being held hostage by automated software that can
  crunch thousands of applications an hour? What kind of training
  could best bridge the gap between employer expectations and
  applicant realities, and who should foot the bill for it? Are
  schools really at fault? Named one of HR Magazine's Top 20
  Most Influential Thinkers of 2011, Cappelli not only changes the
  way we think about hiring but points the way forward to rev
  America's job engine again.

How many will there be? And who will have them? As technology continues to accelerate and machines begin taking care of themselves, fewer people will be necessary. Artificial intelligence is already well on its way to making good jobs obsolete: many paralegals, journalists, office workers, and even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by robots and smart software. As progress continues, blue and white collar jobs alike will evaporate, squeezing working- and middle-class families ever further. At the same time, households are under assault from exploding costs, especially from the two major industrieseducation and health carethat, so far, have not been transformed by information technology. The result could well be massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the consumer economy itself. The past solutions to technological disruption, especially more training and education, aren't going to work. We must decide, now, whether the future will see broad-based prosperity or catastrophic levels of inequality and economic insecurity. Rise of the Robots is essential reading to understand what accelerating technology means for our economic prospectsnot to mention those of our childrenas well as for society as a whole.}
